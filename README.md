# Single-Threaded-Matrix-Multiplication
This coding project explored the concept of single-threaded matrix multiplication and aims to highlight the efficiency differences between single-threaded and multi-threaded implementations. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in computer science, making it an ideal candidate to analyze the impact of parallel processing.
Goals:

Learning the Difference between Single and Multi-Threading: The primary objective of this project is to provide a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of single-threaded matrix multiplication compared to multi-threaded implementations. By building a single-threaded solution, we can gain insights into the complexities involved in multi-threaded programming.

Efficiency Differences: Another key goal of this project is to demonstrate the efficiency disparities between single-threaded and multi-threaded matrix multiplication. By analyzing the performance of both approaches on various matrix sizes, we aim to highlight the scenarios where multi-threading shines and when single-threading may be a suitable choice.

Features:

Implementation of Single-Threaded Matrix Multiplication: We will develop a single-threaded algorithm to multiply two matrices efficiently. This implementation will serve as the baseline for performance comparison.
